# 🤖 Awesome-Agentic-Clinical-Dialogue
This repo includes papers about methods related to agentic clinical dialogue. We believe that the agentic paradi is still a largely unexplored area, and we hope this repository will provide you with some valuable insights!

## 📘 Overview
This framework facilitates a systematic analysis of the intrinsic trade-offs between creativity and reliability by categorizing methods into four archetypes: Latent Space Clinicians, Emergent Planners, Grounded Synthesizers, and Veriffable Workffow Automators. For each paradigm, we deconstruct the technical realization across the entire cognitive pipeline, encompassing strategic planning, memory management, action execution, collaboration, and evolution, to reveal how distinct architectural choices balance the tension between autonomy and safety. Furthermore, we bridge abstract design philosophies with the pragmatic implementation ecosystem. By mapping real-world applications to our taxonomy and systematically reviewing benchmarks and evaluation metrics speciffc to clinical agents, we provide a comprehensive reference for future development.

## 🔑 Key Categories
- 🤖**Latent Space Clinicians (LSC)**. These agents leverage the LLM's vast internal knowledge for creative synthesis and forming a coherent understanding of a clinical situation. Their philosophy is to trust the model's emergent reasoning capabilities to function like an experienced clinical assistant providing insights. For example, the zero/few-shot reasoning capabilities of Med-PaLM or MedAgents exemplify this paradigm.
- 🤖**Emergent Planners (EP)**. This paradigm grants the LLM a high degree of autonomy, allowing it to dynamically devise its own multi-step plan to achieve a complex clinical goal. The agent's behavior is emergent, as it independently determines the necessary steps and goals. Frameworks like AgentMD, which uses ReAct-style prompting.
- 🤖**Grounded Synthesizers (GS)**. These agents operate under the principle that LLMs should function as powerful natural language interfaces to reliable external information rather than as knowledge creators. Their primary role is to retrieve, integrate, and accurately summarize information from verifiable sources like medical databases or imaging data. Exemplars include the foundational frameworks medical retrieval and indexing techniques such as Med-RAG and MA-COIR.
- 🤖**Verifiable Workflow Automators (VWA)**. In this paradigm, agent autonomy is strictly constrained within pre-defined, verifiable clinical workflows or decision trees. The LLM acts as a natural language front-end to a structured process, executing tasks rather than making open-ended decisions, which ensures maximum safety and predictability. This approach is exemplified by commercial triage bots, the structured conversational framework of systems like Google's AMIE, and principles from classic task-oriented dialogue systems sush as MeDi-TODER.
